Features of Bootstrap:  

•	CSS Framework: It's a collection of pre-written CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) code, along with HTML and sometimes     
JavaScript, that provides ready-made styles and structures for common web elements like typography, forms, buttons,    
 navigation menus, and grid layouts.    

•	Free and Open-Source: This means it's available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute without cost.   
Its source code is publicly accessible, encouraging community contributions and improvements.  

•	Developed at Twitter: It was created internally at Twitter as a tool to promote consistency and efficiency   
in developing their internal web applications. Before Bootstrap, different teams at Twitter were using various libraries,   
leading to inconsistencies and increased maintenance.  

•	Responsive and Mobile-First: Bootstrap is designed with responsiveness in mind,   
meaning websites built with it can adapt their layout to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).   
It also emphasizes a "mobile-first" approach, prioritizing the mobile experience from the outset.
